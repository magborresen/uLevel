# uLevel
Is a PCB strain gauge for 3D printer bed leveling

It was originally designed for the HyperCube 3D printer, but is supposed to be able to mount on other printers.

The basic design is using the smallest traces that JLC PCB offers of 0.127mm to create as long traces as possible to raise the resistance. This on done on both side of the PCB.
This is setup in a wheatstone half-bridge with two 10k resistors as the non variable resistors.
